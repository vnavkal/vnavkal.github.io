title: Metasys Parsing Application
tags: []
---

For the last few months, I've been working on an energy data analysis application with my parents.  The application can parse and analyze energy logs produced by Johnson Controls' [Metasys](http://www.johnsoncontrols.com/buildings/building-management/building-automation-systems-bas) system.  Many commercial buildings use this system, and Johnson Controls provides no elegant way for their clients to analyze their energy consumption, so there could be real demand for an application like the one we're developing.

I've deployed our application to EC2, and you can find a link to it in the "Projects" menu above.

It's great to be able to work on an application like this with my family.  We make a fantastic team!  My dad plays the project manager, my mom does the frontend work, and I write the backend data analysis code.
